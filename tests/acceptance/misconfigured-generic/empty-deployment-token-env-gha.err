== [ERROR] you didn't set a token for authentication to semgrep.dev.

You tried logging in as deployment ID #0, but the deployment's API token is set to '' (an empty string).
Please go to https://github.com/[unknown]/settings/secrets/actions and ensure that your token secret (commonly named SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN) is available to this CI job as a GitHub Actions secret.
